# wfuzz
WFuzz is a powerful web application fuzzer included in Kali Linux, primarily used for discovering vulnerabilities by brute-forcing web applications. It allows users to send multiple requests to a target URL, replacing specific placeholders with entries from a wordlist.

### Installation

WFuzz is usually pre-installed in Kali Linux. If it is not available, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wfuzz
```

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using WFuzz is:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z <type>:<wordlist> -u <url>
```

- `-c`: Enables colored output for better readability.
- `-z <type>:<wordlist>`: Indicates the fuzzing type and the path to the wordlist.
- `-u <url>`: The target URL with a placeholder (e.g., `FUZZ`) for fuzzing.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Directory Fuzzing

To find hidden directories on a website:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[200] http://example.com/admin/ [Size: 2345]
[403] http://example.com/private/ [Size: 0]
```

This output indicates that the `/admin/` directory is accessible, while the `/private/` directory returns a forbidden status.

#### Example 2: Fuzzing with Multiple Payloads

To test multiple payloads at once, you can use multiple `-z` options:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/parameters.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ?param=FUZZ
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[200] http://example.com/index.php?param=value1 [Size: 1234]
[404] http://example.com/index.php?param=notfound [Size: 0]
```

#### Example 3: Fuzzing POST Requests

To fuzz POST parameters, use the `-X POST` option along with `-d` to specify the data:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt -u http://example.com/login -X POST -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[200] http://example.com/login [Size: 5678] Found password: admin123
```

#### Example 4: Filtering by Status Code

You can filter results based on HTTP status codes using the `--fc` option:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ --fc 404
```

This command will only show results that do not return a 404 status.

### Conclusion

WFuzz is a versatile tool for web application testing, allowing for effective brute-forcing of directories, files, and parameters. It provides various options for customization, making it suitable for penetration testers and security researchers. Always ensure you have permission to perform fuzzing on the target application to avoid legal issues.

### Installation

WFuzz is usually pre-installed in Kali Linux. If itâ€™s not available, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wfuzz
```

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using WFuzz is:

```bash
wfuzz -c -w <wordlist> -u <url>
```

- `-c`: Enables colored output for better readability.
- `-w <wordlist>`: The path to the wordlist to use for fuzzing.
- `-u <url>`: The target URL, with `FUZZ` as a placeholder where the wordlist entries will be inserted.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Directory Fuzzing

To discover hidden directories on a website:

```bash
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[200]    http://example.com/admin/       [Size: 1234]
[403]    http://example.com/private/     [Size: 456]
```

This output shows that the `/admin/` directory is accessible (HTTP 200), while the `/private/` directory returns a forbidden status (HTTP 403).

#### Example 2: Fuzzing with Parameters

To test for vulnerabilities in a query string:

```bash
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/sqli.txt -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=FUZZ"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[200]    http://example.com/page.php?id=1        [Size: 1234]
[500]    http://example.com/page.php?id=1'       [Size: 0]
```

This output indicates that the input `1'` triggered a server error (HTTP 500), which may suggest a SQL injection vulnerability.

#### Example 3: Fuzzing POST Requests

To fuzz parameters in a POST request:

```bash
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt -u http://example.com/login -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[200]    http://example.com/login              [Size: 1234]  Found password: password123
```

This result indicates that the password `password123` was accepted for the username `admin`.

#### Example 4: Using Multiple Wordlists

You can provide multiple wordlists to target different parts of the URL:

```bash
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/params.txt -u "http://example.com/FUZZ?param=FUZZ"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[200]    http://example.com/admin?param=value   [Size: 1234]
[403]    http://example.com/private?param=value [Size: 456]
```

This output shows successful hits for different combinations of directories and parameters.

### Conclusion

WFuzz is a robust tool for web application testing, allowing users to discover hidden resources and test for vulnerabilities effectively. Its flexibility with wordlists and options makes it a valuable asset for penetration testers.
